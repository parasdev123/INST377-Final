#### Information problem you're trying to solve

- We observe that in our own communities that there may be an unequal distribution in public services which of course limits access for many people. 

#### Identified stakeholders/target browsers

- Our stakeholder is the PG County Officials who will need to make changes in their services if needed. Since the data is about PG county we located all thier public services and if they are not evenly distributed our stakeholders can make a change and improve it for the citizens of PG county.

#### Data you chose to work with

- Dataset to use:

#### Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem

- we build an interactive map that utilizes the locations of libraries, recreation centers, fire stations, and police stations within Prince Georgeâ€™s (PG) county. 

#### Technical system decision rationale

-HTML

-CSS

-JS

-leaflet

-React

-semantic ui

-Axios 

#### How/if your final system helps to address the problem

-Axios : to retrieve data from the backend.

-React-map-gl: to host a map and plot points.

-Semantic-ui/bootstrap: to create the navbar and many other ui elements.



#### Challenges faced and impact on final design

- One challange we faced was that when we deployed the webpage on heroku it created some problems. When the webpage was live it would not display any markers on the map. It was having trouble fetching data from the back end, and would cause the map display to break down.
- Another challange is that we wanted to hear from any of the people that used the website, and wanted to get insight form them. So, we had a contact us page set up, the user could enter their info and send any message to us. The problem we faced is that we had troube sending the message to an email server.

#### Possible future work directions with this problem

- One possible future work is incorparating this state wide and observing services at a state level and see the differences between counties.
- Another one is maybe we could dive deeper in the other facilities that are offered
