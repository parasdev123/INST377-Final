# User Manual

The goal of our website is to help you to find locations of some common facilities, including the police station, fire station, libraries, etc. To use our website, you should have internet access and a basic digital machine, such as a phone and a computer. By clicking our website link, you will be navigated to the website, and you can immediately see our design product. We supply different maps to pin all the police stations, fire stations, libraries, and recreation centers. By using the navigation bars, which are signed as different facilities, you can switch the map of the current facility to the map of other facilities. Also, you can zoom in or zoom out the map for your convenience. If you have further questions to ask our team, you can click the contact us navigation bar and send an email to us. We are happy to listen to your voice and feedback. More than that, if you want to have more knowledge about our project, you can check the further information in the about page. We have more in-depth declarations to inform you. Thank you for your use.
